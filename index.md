# Jay Valentine

I'm a software engineer and Univeristy of York graduate.
I currently work in the automotive software industry, at ETAS Ltd in York.

In my spare time I dabble mainly in electronics and retrocomputing, although I am also interested
in machine learning and game design. You can read more about my projects [here]({% link projects.md %}).

When not hacking away behind a terminal, I enjoy reading, cooking, drinking coffee and taking photographs.

If anything on this site interests you, feel free to get in touch via email, which you can find in the footer.
