# Jay Valentine

I'm a software engineer and Univeristy of York graduate.
I currently work in the automotive software industry, but outside of work
I explore a wide range of topics.

You can read more about my projects [here]({% link projects.md %}).

When not hacking away behind a terminal, I enjoy reading, cooking, coffee and taking photographs.

Feel free to get in touch via email,
which you can find in this site's footer.
