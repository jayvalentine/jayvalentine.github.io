    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        On this page you can read a bit about the things I've done in my spare time.
        These are all ongoing projects that I revisit whenever I find the time.

    <h2>ZFORTH</h2>
    <p>
        ZFORTH is a FORTH implementation targeting the Z80 8-bit microprocessor.
        The core of the language is written entirely in Z80 assembler.
        I'm hoping that it can eventually serve as the shell scripting language for
        a Z80 multi-tasking operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
        FORTH is a programming paradigm in which a lightweight interpreter executes
        'words'. A small set of primitive 'words' are written directly in assembly language,
        but the capability of the environment can be extended, as FORTH allows the ability
        to define new words, and even redefine existing ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Zemu</h2>
    <p>
        Zemu is a Ruby gem (library) which wraps a third-party Z80 CPU emulator, written in C.
        It provides code generation for other components of a system (e.g. memory and IO),
        and the ability to compile the system into a library. This library is then wrapped in a Ruby
        object with which the user can programmatically control the execution of the emulated machine, for example
        by setting breakpoints or accessing memory values.
    </p>
    <p>
        An 'interactive' mode is also provided which allows a user to control the execution of the emulator
        through a command-line interface, as well as exposing a virtual serial port to which a terminal
        emulator can be attached.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zemu has proved valuable during the development of ZFORTH, and I hope that I can use it as a platform
        for prototyping custom Z80 computers that I later intend to build.

    <h2>EvoSim</h2>
    <p>
        EvoSim (short for Evolutionary Simulator) is a simulation of the evolution of a population of creatures
        whose behaviours are controlled by simple neural network 'brains'. The 'brains' evolve through an RT-NEAT
        mechanism, providing real-time changes in the population's traits.
    </p>
    <p>
        The simulator is written in C++, with SDL2 used to provide the graphical capabilities.
    </p>

    <h2>Monolith</h2>
    <p>
        Monolith is a game inspired by epic science-fiction like 2001: A Space Odyssey.
        It is a procedurally-generated text-based game where you must take the place of a
        spacecraft sent to monitor primitive alien civilizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actions you take guide the progression of the tribes through time, but events are not
        entirely under your control, and your decisions may have unexpected consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Monolith is written in TypeScript, and can be played <a href="monolith/index.html">here</a>!
