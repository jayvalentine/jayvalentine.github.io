    <h1>Jay Valentine</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer and Univeristy of York graduate.
        I currently work in the automotive software industry, but outside of work
        I explore a wide range of topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can read more about my projects <a href="/projects.html">here</a>,
        and you can follow along with some of the things I'm doing at the moment
        on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        When not hacking away behind a terminal, I enjoy reading, cooking, coffee and taking photographs.
